\section{Introduction}
The goal of this work is to study the different classifications established among different types of reconfiguration problems.
This study is to help find a general rule or pattern to explain the complexity of reconfiguration problems. In order to do so, the framework for proving the PSPACE completeness of reconfiguration problems is studied in section \ref{sec:NCL}. 
The different categories of reconfiguration problems considered are the following :  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Satisfiability reconfiguration problems.
    \item Binary integer programming reconfiguration problems.
\end{enumerate}
The properties and relevant complexity results concerning each category specified above is given in section \ref{sec:SAT}, section \ref{sec:BIP} respectively. Open questions about this subject are proposed at the end of the article.
