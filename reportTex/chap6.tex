\section{Open questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item What is the connection between the complexity of reconfiguration problems and the complexity of the decision problem on the existence of configurations of a particular kind ? 
    
    \item What properties of problems result in the pattern holding or
    not? Related to the exceptions discussed in section \ref{sec:reconfigureIntro}
    
    \item It is possible to refine Gopalan et al.'s dichotomy even more ? 
    \item (Related to the constrained hypercube path problems) Is the traveling salesman reconfiguration problem (where two tours are adjacent if they differ in two edges) PSPACE-complete?

\end{enumerate}
