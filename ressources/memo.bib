	abstract = {In this paper we describe two Propositional Satisﬁability-based algorithms for solving 0-1 integer linear programs (ILP). The algorithms are speciﬁcally targeted at ILP instances that are highly constrained, i.e. instances for which the constraints are hard to satisfy. The two algorithms are based on recent algorithms for solving instances of Propositional Satisﬁability (SAT) which are also highly constrained. In particular we illustrate how the algorithms for solving ILPs can be improved with search pruning techniques commonly used in SAT algorithms. The usefulness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated on a practical application for which instances are in general highly constrained.},

We provide hardness results for problems in this family, in which the constraints and operations are particularly simple.},

	abstract = {The problem of deciding whether a given propositional formula in conjunctive normal form is satisfiable has been widely studied. I t is known that, when restricted to formulas having only two l i t e r a l s per clause, this problem has an e f f i c i e n t (polynomial-time) solution. But the same problem on formulas having three l i t e r a l s per clause is NP-complete, and hence probably does not have any efficient solution. In this paper, we consider an i n f i n i t e class of s a t i s f i a b i l i t y problems which contains these two particular problems as special cases, and show that every member of this class is either polynomial-time decidable or NP-complete. The i n f i n i t e collection of new NP-complete problems so obtained may prove very useful in finding other new NP-complete problems. The classification of the polynomial-time decidable cases yields new problems that are complete in polynomial time and in nondetermini s t i c log space. We also consider an analogous class of problems, involving quantified formulas, which has the property that every member is e i t h e r polynomialtime decidable or complete in polynomial space.},
